Project summary News Summarizer and Translator from English to Arabic, that can scrape news articles from almost any international news website. Project was made using pre-trained Deep Learning models from Hugging Face.
Motivation Facilitate access to international news to Arabic readers. Inspired by millions of Arabs who can&amp;rsquo;t read English and want to be aware of international politics, events, etc&amp;hellip;
Dataset We used large pre-trained models already fine tuned using huge datasets, so we didn&amp;rsquo;t need to further train them.</description>
